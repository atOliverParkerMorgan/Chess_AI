# Chess (AI included)
this program is a chess UI it comes with a built in AI

## AI
the AI uses
* [MiniMax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) 
* [alpha beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) 
* [null move-heuristic pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null-move_heuristic)
* [move ordering](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9964496/alpha-beta-move-ordering)

* [Evaluation](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Evaluation)

## For what can use this?
* play a game Player vs Player
* play a againts my toy AI 
* watch two AIs battle it out
#### note the AI is very primitive the Evaluation could be much better and the MiniMax alghorithm could be optimized


## How does it look?

## Acknowledgments
the UI is fully functional, but the AI could be much better and faster. My computer calculates about 70 moves per a second ([DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)) calculated 200 million moves per a second)
